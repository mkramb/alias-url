# @alias/client

To streamline the build setup I have used `vite`, which is opinionated and comes with sensible defaults out of the box, but is also highly extensible via its Plugin API and JavaScript API with full typing support.

Even with simple use-case I wanted to demonstrate a scalable architecture using `Vuex`, which is a state management pattern + library for Vue.js applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion.
